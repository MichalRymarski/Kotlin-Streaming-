# KotlinFullStack
Backend and Frontend written fully in Kotlin. My tech stack is :
- Tailwind CSS for styling my components,
- HTMX for network calls,
- Alphine JS for component reactivity,
- Ktor for backend,
- Kotlin HTML DSL  for generating HTML.  
  
The idea is to not write anything beside the Kotlin code needed for HTML generation. I embed Tailwind classes , Alpine and HTMX attributes inside the Kotlin code to make reusable, styled and reactive components.  
This project is a Youtube clone.
